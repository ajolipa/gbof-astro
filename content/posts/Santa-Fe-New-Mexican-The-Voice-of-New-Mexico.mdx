Archive Evaluation: Santa Fe New Mexican
One would anticipate a place named after the “Holy Faith” to possess historical archives of its contribution to Latin history. Santa Fe, known as the Holy Faith in English, is New Mexico’s capital within the United States today. New Mexico starting from the 17th through 20th centuries have suffered through colonization from Spaniards and the United States. During the Mexican-American war, a soldier planted an American flag onto the plaza of the capital. They have built a fort surrounding the flag in order to avoid an uproar of citizens. However, with a low population of 5,000 people, the fort was unnecessary. In the end, the Mexican-American war resulted in Mexico signing a treaty for New Mexico to become an official state in America. Such notable events are quite accessible to research, especially when living in America. However, the voices behind such events become muddled throughout time. Based on the lack of newspapers from Spanish speaking or latino journalists, records of Latin expression and criticism were lost or most likely destroyed. However, some newspaper articles are available from the New Mexican Printing Company, Santa Fe New Mexican researchers to analyze and cherish.


Santa Fe New Mexican is an ongoing daily newspaper first issued in 1849 and remains accessible today. According to wikipedia, the building for its publishing is located at 202 East Marcy Street in Santa Fe. In the 21st century, The New Mexican company invested in a new building for publishing located at One New Mexican Plaza in Santa Fe. The current president is Robin McKinney Martin, the publisher is Tom Cross and editor is Phill Casaus. Santa Fe New Mexican received rewards and recognition through radio shows and television companies in 2015 for its “detailed reporting, evocative writing and strong photography” (1). Such recognition can reflect the accomplishments behind the purpose of the press, to spread the voices of New Mexican citizens. Researchers have done an extended evaluation on how this newspaper contributed towards the events during the 19th and 20th centuries in New Mexico. The article, “Spanish-Language Newspapers in New Mexico, 1834-1958” by A. Gabriel Meléndez, presents an analysis behind the motives, goals, and hopefulness behind Mexican American publishing. The author gave a synopsis of general publishing of newspapers in New Mexico, “Mexican Americans during this time to use their presses to voice sociohistorical concerns and to represent themselves as a determinant group of communities in Nuevo México” (3). This can be applied to the current issue being discussed, as it’s proven to have a sense of voice and representations of Mexican American thoughts and values. Politics was also a running theme in the issue, which could explain how significant it was for Mexican Americans to “voice sociohistorical concerns”. This issue was important to avoid social filtering for their communities. Also in the article, “William Logan Rynerson in New Mexico 1862–1893” by Darlis A. Miller demonstrated Santa Fe New Mexican’s statements on the political issues between Republicans and Democrats. There was some criticism against the Chief Justice of New Mexico, John P. Slough, who described him as “brutal and cowardly” when physically attacking a former Secretary. This emphasizes how opinionated the presses were when writing about current political events. Perhaps a flaw amongst this circumstance is wondering how much of the press contains the opinions of citizens vs the opinions of the editor’s political stance.


In 1903, Volume 40 of Santa Fe New Mexican distributed a variety of subjects behind immigration, urgent news, religion, architecture, politics and unapologetic perspectives. A significant part that helps demonstrate the voices of New Mexico’s citizens themselves was how perspective was shared when discussing religion. A series of texts of multiple topics under the article label, “Monday, April 13th”, presents a brief writing analyzing the violent interactions between Muslims and Christians in Turkey. The text stated, “It must be acknowledged however, that the Musselmen are entitled to the lion’s share of this horrible business — How long will the Sick Man of Europe be allowed to continue in his murderous regime?” (3). Such quotes may reveal who is behind the writing and editing of this publication, as well as the lack of white filtering. This serves as to why such publications were significant, to give voice for the minorities who are not influenced by white and Christian ideals, even amongst the colonization of their land. Santa Fe New Mexican was also advertising their documents in both English and Spanish languages. From speculation, there’s a chance on how Mexicans wanted to be heard from the opposing side as well. To make use of their voices and sensibility as well as a tactic to not submit themselves for white colonizers. Another significant article labeled, “To Advertise The Great Southwest” encouraged people of multiple occupations, including women, to submit letters or articles about living in the southwest in which included New Mexico territory. It encourages “farmers’ wives and daughters” (3) to submit their writing to help advertise parts of their territory. It’s important to note how women had an opportunity to have a voice in a male dominated society. One can evaluate that there’s strength in the number of voices being heard, which would encourage women to partake in writing opportunities. Overall, the Santa Fe New Mexican provided an effective outlet for the people of New Mexico to voice their religious and political and freedom to voice themselves away from the white influence.


In the end, there are some aspects to consider when analyzing specific archives. To find the original editors of Santa Fe New Mexican was not accessible to research, as well as the background information of them. It is also questioned on how much citizen influence contributed to the press in comparison to the editor’s ideals. Even amongst colonization, were their voices effective enough to represent their lack of submission considering the possible limits? All in all, it definitely had a positive impact on their voice in history with how their publications remain ongoing and relevant enough for researchers to invest their time in.
