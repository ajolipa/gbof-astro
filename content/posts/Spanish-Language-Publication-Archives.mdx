*Las Novedades* (1888-1918) was a weekly Spanish-English language publication that was founded in New York by Jose G. Garcia to share current events and political and economic information to the Spanish- speaking community in the United States. This publication rose to become one of the most successful Spanish- language newspapers published during the nineteenth century, and was not only limited to the United States, but the paper started being distributed to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, etc. The New York Public Library archives preserved 286 issues of the newspapers, but only ten specific years rather than the full 20 years. It also seemed like as I got deeper into the early 1900s period, the number of issues I was able to access became fewer.

*Las Novedades* had significant influence on the Hispanic community during that time because Spanish-language newspapers were becoming essential for preserving Hispanic culture and by the late 1800s, Spanish language newspapers were thriving throughout Hispanic communities in the US. Throughout this century, many Latin American countries’ political standings were shifting, including Cuba’s fight for independence from Spain in 1895. This was a substantial factor apart of this publication’s “voice” because there were a lot of controversial opinions regarding these countries’ liberation and patriotism being discussed during this time. “Tenía (*Jose G. Garcia*) una visión más atemperada del papel que debía jugar España ante la nueva situación política y trataba de facilitar el acercamiento entre los españoles y sus antiguas colonias con el fin de estrechar lazos entre todos aquellos que compartían la misma lengua” (Fuentes). 

Specifically, *Las Novedades* prints lengthy issues that aim to target pressing political interests but remains informative about impactful matters happening throughout the Americas that the people needed to be aware of. An example is a column written in a Spanish language issue for August 16, 1888, Correo De Cuba, that reports 48 cardboard boxes of contraband was caught and seized at 10.30pm by Don Enrique Moreno in the Plazuela de San Franciso. They also reported on more substantial events such as in the issue for April 15, 1891, when an Italian American conflict was discussed, and political opinions were shared in the column because eleven Italian immigrants were lynched by a mob in New Orleans. This criminal act would go down to be one of the United States darkest and largest single mass lynches in history and once again, I was shocked by the fact that this was a significant tragedy in immigration history for this county that was not taught in our history classes.  

This assignment provided me with a clearer example of the lack of general archives and information on the Spanish language press during this time. I found it difficult to find the general background of this publication, besides from the actual digital issues in the New York Library archives and most of the information I did find was from sources covering the general topic of Hispanic publication during the 18-1900s. Distibuting and spreading these newspapers allows us to preserve significant milestones for Latinos in the United States.
