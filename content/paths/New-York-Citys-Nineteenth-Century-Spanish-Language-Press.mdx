    blurb: "## La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York\n\nLa Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York (1882-?) was located at 124 Chamber Street. La Revista specialized in short novels, poetry, fashion commentary, and illustrations. This broad specialization thoroughly informed readers in a variety of subjects aside from day-to-day news. This publication company served as a platform for “renowned living writers of the Hispanic world (Kanellos 67). La Revista highlighted the work of renowned authors such as Juan Valera and Rubén Darío, and it famously served as the first newspaper company to publish José Martí’s Nuestra America. The company served an audience of middle and upper class Hispanics from a wide range of locations, even attracting readers in the Caribbean, Central, South America, and the Phillippines. La Revista Ilustrada “saw itself as thoroughly modern and progressive and identified highly with American technology, industrial, and scientific advancement” (Kanellos 68). According to author, Celso Rodriguez in “The Hispanic American Historical Review,” “…Although the emphasis of the magazine was to promote Spanish values, it offered a diversity of\_ intellectual interests, including topics dealing with the United States and Europe” (Rodríguez 763). With its progressive attitude and modern identity, La Revista Ilustrada de Nueva York promoted pan-Hispanic unity in resisting American interventionism and modern-day colonialism.\n\nWork Cited: Bolet Peraza, N. “La Revista Ilustrada De Nueva York.” 1882. de Beer, Gabriella. “IN PURSUIT OF ‘LA REVISTA ILUSTRADA,’ A 19th CENTURY NEW YORK MAGAZINE.” Bilingual Review / La Revista Bilingüe, vol. 4, 1977, pp. 145–146.
