      When I was kicked out of the bookstore, I briefly took refuge in this
      church.

    blurb: |
      I quickly left the church, for three reasons:

      1. I'm not religious;
      2. Pews are not comfy to sleep on;
      3. I missed my books.

      I got a job working at A.W. Howes Printer.
