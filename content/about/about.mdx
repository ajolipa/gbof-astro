New York City has long served as a major publishing center in the history of Latin American and Latinx literature. At the end of the nineteenth century, the city’s Latin American publishing community was centered in [the very neighborhood that surrounds Pace University.](https://g.page/pace-university-new-york?share) Understanding lower Manhattan’s role as a publishing center for Latin Americans living in New York at that time will provide us with examples of the ways in which print history can inform our understanding of the formation of Latinx literature and culture. This session will also give us a chance to experience the ways in which our current understanding of this history is still unfolding. As we will see, there are many gaps that remain to be filled in the history of the Latinx press in the nineteenth century in the United States.
